# Pokedex

A simple Pokedex application built using Android Studio, this app fetches Pokémon data from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays detailed information about each Pokémon, including their attributes and stats. It also includes a basic Firestore integration, enabling the downloading and deletion of Pokémon records.
